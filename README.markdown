### WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
Just a tiny little evented server I wrote in Java to remind myself how the nio non-blocking stuff works.

### WILL IT SOLVE MY PROBLEMS?
If your problems include not being able to find code samples for using the nio Java library to implement an
event-driven server, then it might.

### NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS INTERESTING, EXCITING OR CUTTING EDGE
Nope. But here's some good reading that was used to put it together
